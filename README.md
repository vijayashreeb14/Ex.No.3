### Name : VIJAYASHREE B
### REGISTER NUMBER :212223040238
### Aim:

To demonstrate four prompt engineering types (Straightforward, Tabular, Preceding Question, Missing Word) for the chosen use case from **Modulation Techniques for Multimedia Signals**, and evaluate them using **Tabular Format Prompting**.

---

### Use Cases (for all Prompt Types):

1. **Straightforward Prompts** â†’ Useful for quick revision of basic modulation concepts before an exam.
2. **Tabular Format Prompting** â†’ Best for structured comparison of AM, FM, and QPSK techniques in study or engineering tasks.
3. **Preceding Question Prompting** â†’ Helps students understand "why" modulation is necessary and "how" specific techniques (like QPSK/FM) solve real communication problems.
4. **Missing Word Prompting** â†’ Suitable for recall-based practice or fill-in-the-blank style exam questions.

## 1. Straightforward Prompts

**Prompt 1:**
ðŸ‘‰ "Define modulation in one sentence."
**Response:**
Modulation is the process of varying a carrier signal to transmit information efficiently.

**Prompt 2:**
ðŸ‘‰ "List three modulation techniques used in satellite communication for multimedia signals."
**Response:**
The three commonly used modulation techniques are Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK).

## 2. Tabular Format Prompting

**Prompt 1:**
ðŸ‘‰ "Provide a table comparing AM, FM, and QPSK modulation techniques in terms of signal quality, bandwidth, and application."

**Response:**

| Modulation | Signal Quality         | Bandwidth Requirement | Application                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| AM         | Poor (noise sensitive) | Low                   | Voice transmission               |
| FM         | Good, less noise       | Medium                | Radio & TV broadcast             |
| QPSK       | High, robust           | High                  | Digital TV, satellite multimedia |

---

**Prompt 2:**
ðŸ‘‰ "Create a table showing three advantages and three disadvantages of QPSK modulation in satellite communication."

**Response:**

| Advantages of QPSK              | Disadvantages of QPSK                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| High spectral efficiency        | Requires complex receiver design                |
| Better noise immunity           | More prone to phase errors                      |
| Suitable for multimedia signals | Needs higher bandwidth than simpler modulations |

## 3. Preceding Question Prompting

**Prompt 1:**
ðŸ‘‰ "Why is modulation necessary in satellite communication? Explain how QPSK helps in multimedia transmission."
**Response:**

* Modulation is necessary to efficiently transmit signals over long distances, minimize interference, and make efficient use of bandwidth.
* QPSK allows transmission of 2 bits per symbol, which increases data rate and ensures reliable multimedia communication.

**Prompt 2:**
ðŸ‘‰ "How does FM provide better quality compared to AM in satellite communication? Explain with reason."
**Response:**

* FM provides better quality because it is less sensitive to amplitude noise and interference compared to AM.
* This makes FM more suitable for audio and video broadcasting over satellites.

**Prompt 2:**
ðŸ‘‰ "QPSK modulation encodes \_\_\_\_ bits per symbol."
**Response:**
